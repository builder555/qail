The governance framework outlines the processes for proposing, debating, and implementing changes to the network. It includes a decision-making body comprising diverse stakeholders, including developers, token holders, and industry experts.

_Community Voting_: a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure where token holders can propose changes via a formalized proposal system, similar to Ethereum's EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals). Votes can be weighted based on the number of tokens held or through a quadratic voting system to prevent wealth concentration from dictating all decisions.

_Election of Council_: a governing council elected by token holders for fixed terms. Token holders could elect seven council members annually to oversee major decisions, similar to the MakerDAO's governance framework.

_Transparent Proposal System_: platforms like Aragon or Snapshot are used for transparent proposal submissions and voting, where every action is recorded on-chain for accountability.

_On-chain Governance Mechanisms_: smart contracts that automatically enforce certain decisions based on the outcome of community votes, ensuring that the governance process is not just a recommendation but is binding and automatically executed on the blockchain.
